now lets think about subarray problems (max,min subarray length or find the 
or substringss accorginto a given set of conditions
find subarray ,
 find the longest substring with unique 
find the longest substring with unique characters or oslving problems 
fixed size window 
2 for loop we tshoof every possible subarray 
y2ma efficent approach any a3ml array of also integet size  
doing n2 time compliexity 
optimize this opperation ahh mmkn a3mlha fe k  size subarray
update the previous sum as shown 
k subarray window 0 ,l- 
the result like 
current sum =9 
max sum=9  kol shwya hincrease current sum 
left pointer right pointer 
the sum of each sum array 
feha nw3eeen     ffixed size sliding window 
varaible size sliding window 
        fixed size sliding window 
) 
fixed (
required say ke cimmpute the result include the k elements of the data structure 
for loop to slide the window by oen

)
varaible (
1_ lw condition btrue inc right pointer inc window
lw b flase inc left pointer  shrink the window 
)
idendity the problem (
require finding the  
subarray ,substring, o(n2) 
to find the maxi sum of 
)
